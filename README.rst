NEXTorch
=========

NEXTorch is an open-source software package in Python/PyTorch to faciliate 
experimental design using Bayesian Optimization (BO). 

NEXTorch stands for Next EXperiment toolkit implementation in PyTorch/BoTorch. 
It is also a library for learning the theory and implementation of Bayesian Optimization.
